## Run

```bash
pnpm i
pnpm dev
```

<!-- ## Why? -->

<!-- Will be an app similar to [2Do](https://www.2doapp.com/), [Height](https://height.app/) and [Ship GitHub client](https://www.realartists.com/blog/ship-20.html).

Currently this is my todo setup:

![](https://images.nikiv.dev/obsidian-todo-23.png)

> [Obsidian](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/tools/obsidian) is current favored way as it lets me nest tasks and sort into sections

![](https://images.nikiv.dev/2do-23.png)

> [2Do](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/macOS/apps/2do) for tasks that need some kind of due date

> [Telegram](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/tools/telegram)'s Saved Messages for everything else. Tweets I want to act on soon, random thoughts etc.

> [Height](https://height.app/) to manage [goals](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/focusing/goals) and [ideas](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/ideas), it has nice way to add detail to a big task with subtasks

This app will bring all those 4 use cases into one clean and **fast** app.

I need to fix [this annoying issue](https://github.com/alex8088/electron-vite/issues/118). If you know a fix, please reply. -->

## Build

```
pnpm run build
```

<!-- ## Notes

Solid apps are built with _adapters_, which optimise your project for deployment to different environments.

By default, `bun run build` will generate a Node app that you can run with `npm start`. To use a different adapter, add it to the `devDependencies` in `package.json` and specify in your `vite.config.js`. -->
